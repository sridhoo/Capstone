AI Voice-Powered Meal Planner
Project Overview
The AI Meal Planner project enables users to generate personalized meal plans based on their health goals and food preferences, driven entirely by voice commands. Users can speak their age, height, weight, gender, health goals, preferred cuisine, and meal type, and the application automatically generates a customized meal plan.
Features
- Voice-Driven Inputs: Fill all form fields (age, weight, height, goal, cuisine) by speaking.
- Custom Meal Plan Generator: Personalized daily meal plans based on user goals.
- Calorie and Nutrition Tracking: Visual charts showing calories per meal.
- Downloadable Meal Plan: Export meal plans as CSV files.
- Speech Recognition: Built-in support for voice interaction.
- User-Friendly Interface: Developed with Streamlit for easy web interaction.
How It Works
1. Open the application in a web browser (localhost:8501).
2. Click 'Speak Now' and provide your:
   - Age
   - Height
   - Weight
   - Gender
   - Health Goal (e.g., weight loss, muscle building)
   - Preferred Cuisine (e.g., Indian, Mexican)
   - Meal Type (e.g., Breakfast, Lunch)
3. The application generates a personalized meal plan and displays a calorie chart.
4. Users can download their meal plan as a CSV file.
Future Enhancements
- Deploy the application online (Streamlit Sharing / AWS / Azure).
- Add multilingual speech recognition support.
- Save user preferences and history to a database.
- Integrate OpenAI Whisper model for improved speech-to-text accuracy.
